# General Assembly Wordle Project

[Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) is a puzzle game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. The game became a viral sensation and has remained the same while it has realised its success.

This project is an attempt to improve on the concept with new ideas and game modes, fun & exciting graphics and themes and, if the player wants, the ability to revert back to the base game without having to venture to the pesky New York Times website.

In this project created by aspiring software engineer Will Sikora three game modes have been devised:

- Wordle Original
- Speedle
- Cryptol

## Wordle Original
---
A recreation of the same base gameplay created by Josh Wardle, this version gives players the ability to play the original viral game within the Wordle Project ecosystem on the fly. With an updated visual interface this game mode will be a good break from the other modes offered!

### How to Play
- Guess the WORDLE in six tries.
- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.
- After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

Letter backgrounds:
- Green: The letter is in the word and in the correct spot
- Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot
- Grey: The letter is not in the word in any spot

## Speedle
---
This game mode is designed for players that feel the reason Wordle was purchased by New York Times is that its old, slow and boring just like the newspapers New York Times makes. 

In this game mode players have 3 minutes to solve as many Wordles as possible with their streak being tallied as they guess correctly. Don't be surprised if you get a jolt as you build momentum! 

### How to Play
- Besides the base tile rules (see Wordle Original How to Play) there is one other thing players should know.
- To start or reset the timer players need only to press the 'Start⚡ Reset' button at the top of the page.

**NOTE**: Win streak will reset if the start⚡ reset button is pressed!

## Cryptol *(Previously Chronol)*
---
Currently a work in progress, Cryptol looks to redefine the Wordle-type gamespace. 

Cryptol is a visionary new game mode that has the player decrypt an 8 letter word called a Cryptol.

### How to Play
- At the start of each game an 8 letter word is chosen at random and encrypted using a randomly scrambled alphabet. Each round (of 6 attempts) the player must guess the cryptol in an attempt to crack the code. 
- To aid the player the system provides a key which gives the player insight into up to 3 of the decrypted letters.

**For Example**: the key shows "GRE = LJS", the player now knows that G=L, R=J, E=S. 

- To make the process simpler, the game takes the decoded letters and changes all encoded letters in the Cryptol, changes them to their real letters, and turns the tiles green. This way the player knows these letters are "solved"
- If the player guesses the cryptol correctly the game ends
- After each round of unsuccessful guesses the a letter in the encrypted answer is revealed
